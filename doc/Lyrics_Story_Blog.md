According to the word clouds above, there are some interesting changes. First of all, in the early days of Hip-Hop songs, they don't really care about love. The pursuit of sensuality and material is their focus. In the following decades, the trend start to behave like other genres talking about love and time. Another interesting situation is that dirt words are used more frequent than other songs. 

Hip-hop originated from the bottom people of the United States. At that time, the United States had huge problems such as huge gap between the rich and the poor and racial discrimination. In the face of a huge class divide, the black people who are discriminated against are destitute, are powerless to change. They can only choose to use dirty words and expressions to vent their dissatisfaction with social injustice and dissatisfaction with white people.

From another perspective, if you want to be a qualified hip hop singer, you need to be comfortable with dirty words.

Although Hip-Hop singers like to use dirty languages, the words like 'love', 'time', 'baby' still appears in both categories and rank top. It says these topics are really the most concerned ones among all works of life. 

This shows that if you want to be a Hip-Hop singer, you don't need to be completely different from everyone else. There are many similarities between the singers' hotspots and the topics they want to express. You just need to learn to say more swearing words.

### 2. Size Of Vocabulary

In this part, I want to find some characteristics of Hip-Hop song's word numbers. We all know that Hip-Hop needs to speek fast, but how much faster are they? The following graphs show the characteristics of average word count by all genres.

The bar plot above shows that the average words per song are more than twice as many others, which makes this type of genre very distinct. As a common confusion, R&B is hardly distinguished from Hip-Hop by many people. But as depicted above, the number of words bettwen these two are enormous.

In addition, with the assumption that the average song length is almost the same across different genres, it can be concluded that Hip-Hop singers must speak more than twice as faster as other singers.

From the box diagram above, we can also see that there are about 25 percent Hip-Hop whose lyrics are in the same range of other genres. This means if you can't sing very fast, you still have chance to become a Hip-Hop singer.
