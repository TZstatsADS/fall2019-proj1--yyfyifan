### Requirements

The `requirements.txt` in lib folder stores the libraries installed in my environment. To successfully run the Jupiter notebook, it is recommended to ensure all the libraries are installed in your running environment.

The library list is complete but not minimized. There are some irrelevant files that has nothing to do with this project.

Some of these libraries may require different command to install. If there are any issues installing them, please refer to the corresponding official website and documentation.
