### [Project Description](doc/)
Term: Fall 2019

+ Project title: What's Unique About Hip-Hop ? Is Eminem An Alien?.
+ This project is conducted by Yifan Yang (yy2955)

+ Project summary: Hip-hop is a very representative genre of songs, as we all know its speed of singing is extraordinary fast. But apart from that, is it really different from other styles? Is Eminem's success just a coincidence? Or does he really have his uniqueness? There are many treasures hidden behind the lyrics, and we can find many rules and characteristics by exploring them. If you have ever dreamed of becoming a hip hop singer, you may want to get some inspiration through the secrets hidden in the lyrics.
