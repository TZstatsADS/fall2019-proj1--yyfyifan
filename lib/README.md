# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).



### Requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` in lib folder stores the libraries installed in my environment. To successfully run the Jupiter notebook, it is recommended to ensure all the libraries are installed in your running environment.

1. TextBlob

   conda install -c conda-forge textblob
